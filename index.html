			DISH or DIRECTV? How to Pick the Best DVR</p>			
		</div> -->
		<hr>
		<p class="paragraph">We've decided to compare the most popular DVRs Dish and DirecTV have to offer, and we're ready to give our recommendation. 

		<p>In our research, we wanted to focus on the most important features: <strong> recording capacity, internal storage, </strong> and <strong> simultaneous recording </strong>. We also included an exclusive feature from each company,  and because some DVR features rely on specific service plans, we'll provide some insight into what the two companies offer with their DVRs (there's the price too, but we'll get to that). <!-- Choosing a DVR isn't easy. --> </p>

		<h2>DIRECTV DVRs</h2>

		<p>There are currently only four DVRs available directly from DirecTV, and one is not like the others. DirecTV's top model, the Genie (HR44), is packed with features; in fact, when comparing it to other DirecTV DVRs, the Genie is easily the best.</p>

		<p>The Genie has a recording capacity of 200 hours in HD (800 hours in SD), a 1 TB internal hard drive, and the capability of recording five shows at once&mdash;more than enough for us. The next two options, the HD DVR (HR24) and the TiVo HD DVR (THR22), are essentially the same, but each can only do half of what the Genie does (see table below). As for the standard DVR (R22), its 125 GB hard drive and lack of simultaneous recording makes it the barebones option. </p>

		<h3>Exclusive Feature: Time Machine</h3>
		
		<p>DirecTV lets you "reverse time and immmediately watch shows that aired in the last 72 hours&mdash;even if you forgot to record them." But when checking the fine print, this feature only works with 37 networks total, and we couldn't find what networks they are.</p>
		
		<h2>DISH DVRs</h2>

		<p>We found five DVRs available directly from Dish (see table below). Much like DirecTV, Dish's top model, the Hopper (ES197107), stands out from the rest of Dish's DVRs. </p>

		<p>The Hopper packs a 2 TB internal hard drive (double DirecTV's Genie), which by our numbers, allows 400 hours of HD recording (1600 hours in SD). It also can record up to eight shows at once (the Genie only does five, but we're still not sure we need more than that.) Compared to the Hopper, other Dish DVRs seem... well, inadequate. The DuoDVR ViP (722k) has a 500 GB internal hard drive (one-fourth of the Hopper), and can only record two shows at once. Subsequent DVRs continue to drop in recording capacity and storage size (see table below).</p>

		<h3>Exclusive Feature: Remote Locator</h3>

		<p>Dish has a "remote control locator." We've haven't done a hands-on test, but the idea of no longer rummaging through our couch cushions excites us. </p> 
		
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<p>The Hopper earns our recommendation for best DVR.</p>

		<p>Though we're skeptical we'll need to record more than 5 shows at once, the 2 TB of internal storage in the Hopper gives us enough recording capacity so we'll never have to delete our favorite shows, even long after they're over (looking at you Justified.)</p>

		<h3>Wait, What About the Price?</h3>

		<p>We spoke with representatives from Dish and DirecTV. Currently, both the Genie and the Hopper are "free" for new customers. Of course, "free" means strings attached. Expect a two-year contract and penalties from either company if you end your contract early. And your monthly fee will differ depending on your channel selection and other packages (e.g. internet service package).</p>
