		<p class="paragraph">Choosing a DVR isn't easy, so we decided to compare the most popular models Dish and DirecTV have to offer.</p> 

		<p>In our research, we wanted to focus on only the most important features: <strong> recording capacity, internal storage, simultaneous recording,</strong> and <strong>"comfort features"</strong> (we'll explain this). And because some DVR features rely on specific monthly service plans, we'll provide some insight into what the two companies offer with their DVRs. </p>

		<h2>DIRECTV DVRs</h2>

		<p>We were surprised by DirecTV's smaller selection: there are currently only four DVRs available directly from DirecTV. Luckily, DirecTV has the Genie (HR44), and it's packed with features; in fact, when comparing it to other DirecTV DVRs, the Genie is by far the best.</p>

		<p>The Genie boasts a recording capacity of 200 hours in HD (800 in SD), a 1 TB internal hard drive, and the capability of recording 5 shows at once. If that's more than you want, your next option is the HD DVR (HR24), but it's signifcant drop   </p>
